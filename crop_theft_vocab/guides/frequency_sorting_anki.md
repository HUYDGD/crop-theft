3. On the middle top menu, click `Browse`.

4. Right click the sort bar. You should see options such as `Deck` `Sort Field` `First Review` `Interval` on this bar.

5. Hover over `- Fields -` -> `Crop Theft Vocab` and click on the `Frequency` field.

6. Find the `Frequency` field on the sort bar. (You may need to use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom)

7. Sort `Frequency` ascending. (Arrow/triangle pointing up `â–²`)

8. Press `Ctrl` + `a`.

9. Right click on any of the highlighted cards.

10. Select `Reposition`.

11. Verify that `Randomize order` is unchecked.
